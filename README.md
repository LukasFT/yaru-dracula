# yaru-dracula

Half-assed modifications to the awesome
[yaru](https://github.com/ubuntu/yaru) theme to use the colors from
the awesome [Dracula theme](https://draculatheme.com/).

This will probably always be outdated and pointing to some random
commit. But... be my guest to send a PR that merges the latest master
:)
